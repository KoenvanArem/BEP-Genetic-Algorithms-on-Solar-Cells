# BEP-Genetic-Algorithms-on-Solar-Cells

This repository contains of implementations corresponding to the bachelor thesis 'Optimization of tandem solar cells with genetic algorithms' by Koen W. van Arem.<br/>
The implementations are written in Matlab in which the Global Optimization Toolbox and the Parallel Computing Toolbox are used. These need to be installed in order to be able to run the code.

This repository consists of three folders:
  1. The first folder called 'Old_Version' contains the old version of the genetic algorithm with an old an inaccurate objective function. This implementation is  described in the Appendix.
  2. The second folder called 'Impemented_Version' contains the genetic algorithm that is implemented as described in Chapter 4. This implementation is used to obtain the results in Chapter 5.
  3. The third folder called 'Best_Implementation' contains the genetic algorithm that is found to be the best implementation based on the results in Chapter 5. 

Each folder contains a README.md file that further explains the use of the code.

For any questions regarding the code in this repository, please contact k.w.vanarem@student.tudelft.nl
